# Design and Implementation of a Payment Gateway System in Python

## What is a Payment Gateway?

A Payment Gateway is a technology that facilitates secure online transactions between customers, merchants, <br>
and financial institutions. It acts as an intermediary to process and authorize payments securely.

## High-Level Design of a Payment Gateway System

A Payment Gateway System involves multiple steps: <br>

1. User Initiates Payment:
   -  The user enters payment details (credit/debit card, UPI, net banking). <br>
   -  The details are encrypted and sent to the payment gateway. <br>
2. Merchant Requests Payment Processing:
   -  The payment gateway forwards the request to the acquiring bank. <br>
3. Transaction Verification:
   -  The acquiring bank routes the request to the card network (Visa, MasterCard). <br>
   -  The issuing bank verifies card details and checks for sufficient balance. <br>
4. Payment Authorization:
   -  If verified, the issuing bank sends an Authorization Code. <br>
   -  The gateway notifies the merchant of the success. <br>
5. Funds Settlement:
   -  The transaction is settled via a clearing process where funds are transferred from the issuing bank to the merchant’s bank. <br>
6. Final Transaction Status:
   -  The merchant confirms the payment and provides order fulfillment.

  
##  Key Components

1. Merchant <br>
   -  The entity (e.g., an e-commerce website) requesting payment processing. <br>
2. Customer <br>
   -  The user making the payment. <br>
3. Payment Gateway <br>
   -  The intermediary handling payment processing. <br>
4. Acquiring Bank <br>
   -  The merchant’s bank that processes transactions. <br>
5. Issuing Bank <br>
   -  The customer’s bank that approves or declines the transaction. <br>
7. Card Networks <br>
   -  Networks like Visa, MasterCard, and Rupay that facilitate transactions. <br>


## Payment Flow Diagram
```
Customer → Merchant → Payment Gateway → Acquiring Bank → Card Network → Issuing Bank <br>
                    ← Payment Status  ←  ←  ←  ←  ←
```

##  How the Code Works

1. Encrypts Card Details: <br>
   -  Uses SHA-256 hashing to avoid storing raw card data. <br>
2. Processes Payment: <br>
   -  Generates a transaction ID using secrets.token_hex(8). <br>
   -  Simulates bank verification (expiry, CVV, amount checks). <br>
   -  If valid, the transaction is stored as "Success". <br>
3. Checks Transaction Status: <br>
   -  The user can verify their transaction status using the transaction ID. <br>


##  Enhancements for Real-World Implementation

1. Use a Payment API: <br>
   -  Integrate with real APIs like Stripe, Razorpay, or PayPal instead of mock verification. <br>
2. Secure Card Handling: <br>
   -  Use Tokenization (PCI-DSS compliance) instead of hashing. <br>
   -  Store sensitive data in a secure vault (e.g., AWS KMS). <br>
3. Fraud Prevention Measures: <br>
   -  Rate Limiting: Prevent multiple payment attempts. <br>
   -  OTP Verification: Authenticate users before processing payments. <br>
   -  AI-based Fraud Detection: Identify suspicious transactions. <br>
4. Logging and Monitoring: <br>
   -  Implement audit logs for all transactions. <br>
   -  Use tools like Splunk or ELK Stack for monitoring. <br>
